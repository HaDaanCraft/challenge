## Web Dev Challenges - The Coding Sultan
Here you're able to find the finished web development challenges of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/thecodingsultan">The Coding Sultan</a> by me (<a href="http://www.instagram.com/powit.be">Powit</a>). I made use of html and plain css in combination with JQuery. No frameworks needed or used.

## Practice
In my opinion, I found out that the best way to learn something new, in this case front-end web development, is to copy from other people who already have an experience. This is the way how I learned programming myself by looking to how others did it and then trying to do the same. I recommend everyone trying out these Web Dev Challenges, the guidelines and the Sketch files are in the project files - <a href="href="http://www.linktr.ee/thecodingsultan">Here</a>.
